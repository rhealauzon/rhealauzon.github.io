        Hometown Odyssey is an Android interactive game in which users must travel around their
        local neighborhoods in order to collect treasures that can be used to upgrade
        their character in game. The application makes use of the Google Maps API.

        <br><br>Hometown Odyssey was created by myself and Christofer Klassen as part of an introductory Android class.
