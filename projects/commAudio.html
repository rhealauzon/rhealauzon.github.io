        Comm Audio is a multicast streaming program that allows a user to create a music server that
        may be connected to by other local computers. Listeners may listen to the tracks on a playlist that are
        being streamed, play a specific song from the server's library, or download a song for later.

        <br><br>Comm Audio was written in C++ using QT for the graphical interface.
