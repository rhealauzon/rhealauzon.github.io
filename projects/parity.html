    <p id="projectTitle">Parity</p>
    <p id="projDescrpt">Parity is an educational game that revolves around a simple grid of cards that the player can interact with.
        Lining the edges of the grid are "parity" cards, which represent the parity of the given row or column that they are aligned with.
        The player's goal is to swap cards back into their correct position such that the errors have been corrected by matching the parity card.
        Parity was made in order to create a visual representation of how parity checks work as part of the error detection and correction process
        of networking protocols.

        <br><br>Parity was made using GameMaker 2.0.
