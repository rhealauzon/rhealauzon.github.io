        Dog Yarn It is an Android application developed for Astor Tsang, a Vancouver-based knitter and entrepreneur. The project
        was completed in three months as part of an industry project class at BCIT. The application allows a user to input
        the measurements of their dog in order to generate a custom step-by-step knitting guide to knit a dog sweater.

        <br><br>Dog Yarn It was created by myself, Christofer Klassen, Eric Tsang, and Georgi Hristov.
